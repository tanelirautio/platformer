Game overview:
--------------
- This game will be intended for young kids who haven't played console platformers at all
  -> Losing all health just puts you back to start of the level with default health
  -> Every level starts with 0 score. Best scores are saved per level. (Maybe we can show cumulated best score somewhere though...)
- Overall difficulty should be quite easy and the difficulty should ramp up quite slowly
- Extra difficulty and/or replayability are added via level trophies which may become more difficult to obtain faster
- Some hard to get level specific achievements can be also designed

- All external code/libs/assets should be either Public Domain (CC0) or use some "just give attribution in credits" license.
- For simplicity the levels are made from traditional square tiles, no slopes or any advanced polygons
- Character selection is purely cosmetics, they all behave the same way

TODO:

High priority:
--------------
- Remove killzone completely (box the play area with borders in every level, not possible to die by falling)
- Menus to work with 5:4 resolution (inside brick frame - maybe get rid of scroll lists or just hardcode the lists...)
- Redesign level selection menu to work nicely with 5:4 aspect ratio as well - use brick frames and smaller level sprites
- Level end menu to work correctly (also design what happens when playing another time? Easy way: just continue normally... :)
  -> Show clearly:
    * Trophies that you got / Trophies you haven't got / Trophies that you've got on earlier runs
    * Level par time, your time and overall best time
    * Level required score & your score
  -> If first time play, just advance here to next level
  -> If playing a level again, show possibility to continue to next level and possibility exit to level select screen
  -> Give extra points for remaining hearts at the end of the level
- Death animation for all players
- ~10 levels sort-of-semi-finished playable state (at the end of May if possible?)

Medium priority:
----------------
- Spike ball trap
- Make jump pad to work correctly
- Pause menu
  -> Opens with esc (kb) or select (gamepad)
  -> Exit to level select or continue game
  -> Possibly some other options if needed
- Circular Saw sound

Low priority:
-------------
- Menu selection can be scrolled when button is kept down
- More traps (Libs/Pixel Adventure 1/Assets/Traps)
  -> Implemented trap sprites are then moved to Assets/Sprites and traps are made as prefabs
- More powerups
  -> invulnerability, more speed, ability to wall climb etc.
  -> can be also power downs, for example temporary darkness, some sinewave distortion pixel shader effect etc.
- Visualize health removal better -> black/broken heart tweens to health bar or similar...?
- Animated enemies (need to import Pixel Adventure 2 asset pack from Asset Store into the project)
	-> Static
	-> Path moving
	-> Charging when player near

Nice to haves:
--------------
- 2-player co-op mode
- Intermediate scenes between levels
- Simple dialog system and friendly NPC interaction
- Wall climb (code is in, just disabled atm.)
- Double jump
- Push buttons to activate things in level

Probably never happen:
----------------------
- Boss fights
- Multiple save slots
- Ladders

Done and/or fixed:
-----------------
- Checkpoint system (Libs/Pixel Adventure 1/Assets/Checkpoints)
- Teleports
- Keep the menu music playing continuously when returning to main menu from submenu
- Allow player to fall from jump through platform (tag: "through") when pressing down
  - NOTE: 'press' vs 'is pressed' - currently 'is pressed' triggers fallthrough
