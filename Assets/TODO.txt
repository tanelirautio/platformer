Game overview:
--------------
- This game will be intended for young kids who haven't played console platformers at all
  -> Losing all health just puts you back to start of the level with default health
  -> Every level starts with 0 score. Best scores are saved per level. (Maybe we can show cumulated best score somewhere though...)
- Overall difficulty should be quite easy and the difficulty should ramp up quite slowly
- Extra difficulty and/or replayability are added via level trophies which may become more difficult to obtain faster
- Some hard to get level specific achievements can be also designed

- All external code/libs/assets should be either Public Domain (CC0) or use some "just give attribution in credits" license.
- For simplicity the levels are made from traditional square tiles, no slopes or any advanced polygons
- Character selection is purely cosmetics, they all behave the same way

TODO:

Menus:
------
- Menu selection can be scrolled when button is kept down
- Level selection menu
- Make them look more nicer (if time allows)

Game:
-----
- In-game menu/pause
  -> Opens with esc (kb) or select (gamepad)
  -> Exit to level select or continue game
  -> Possibly some other options if needed
- Implement more traps (Libs/Pixel Adventure 1/Assets/Traps)
  -> Implemented trap sprites are then moved to Assets/Sprites and traps are made as prefabs
- Implement more powerups
  -> invulnerability, more speed, ability to wall climb etc.
  -> can be also power downs, for example temporary darkness, some sinewave distortion effect etc.
  -> suggestions are welcome :D
- Enemies (need to import Pixel Adventure 2 asset pack from Asset Store into the project)
  -> Some different simple behaviors that can be selected
- Better level end UI (that can be scrolled with user input OR shows all relevant info in one screen)
  - Show clearly:
    -> Trophies that you got / Trophies you haven't got / Trophies that you've got on earlier runs
    -> Level par time, your time and overall best time
    -> Level required score & your score
  - If first time play, just advance here to next level
  - If playing a level again, show possibility to continue to next level and possibility exit to level select screen
- Give extra points for remaining hearts at the end of the levels

Levels:
-------
- Need to design some levels, probably after more traps & enemies :D

Ideas that need to be evaluated:
--------------------------------
- Wall climb (code is in, just disabled atm.)
- Double jump
- Dash (Need to think if is this evading game only, or can the enemies stomped and/or dashed...)
- Checkpoint system (Libs/Pixel Adventure 1/Assets/Checkpoints)
  Possibilities:
    -> When player gets hit always respawn at checkpoint?
    -> When player loses all hearts, respawn at checkpoint instead of level start?
- Multiple save slots
- 2 player co op mode
- Menu coherence, is there need to make all to UI system (Canvas)
- Boss fights
- Push buttons to activate things in level
- Ladders
- Jump pad
- Simple dialogue system: Player encounters NPC, some text is shown in a dialog box and the dialog continues/exits with pressing fire button

Done and/or fixed:
-----------------
- Teleports
- Statistics menu (just reuse Achievement menu code...) [just add more stats there in the future!]
- Settings menu (it's ugly but hey it works!) Maybe menus get more love after the actual game is playable
  - NOTE: scrollable menus are a bit broken if used with mouse/touch. In initial release controls are gamepad/keyboard and mouse/touch will be disabled so not an issue. Good keep in mind though if/when adding support for mouse/touch. 
- Keep the menu music playing continuously when returning to main menu from submenu
- Allow player to fall from jump through platform (tag: "through") when pressing down
  - NOTE: 'press' vs 'is pressed' - currently 'is pressed' triggers fallthrough
