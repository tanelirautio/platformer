TODO:

Menus:
------
- Menu selection can be scrolled when button is kept down
- Keep the menu music playing continuously when returning to main menu from submenu
  (for example: returning from achievements menu back to main menu, music starts over)
- Level selection menu
- Statistics menu (just reuse Achievement menu code...)
- Settings menu

Game:
-----
- Allow player to fall from jump through platform (tag: "through") when pressing down
- Implement more traps (Libs/Pixel Adventure 1/Assets/Traps)
  -> Implemented trap sprites are then moved to Assets/Sprites and traps are made as prefabs
- Implement more powerups
  -> invulnerability, more speed, ability to wall climb etc.
  -> can be also power downs, for example temporary darkness, some sinewave distortion effect etc.
  -> suggestions are welcome :D
- Enemies (need to import Pixel Adventure 2 asset pack from Asset Store into the project)
  -> Some different simple behaviors that can be selected
- Better level end UI (that can be scrolled with user input OR shows all relevant info in one screen)
  - Show clearly:
    -> Trophies that you got / Trophies you haven't got / Trophies that you've got on earlier runs
    -> Level par time, your time and overall best time
    -> Level required score & your score

Levels:
-------
- Need to design some levels, probably after more traps & enemies :D

Ideas that need to be evaluated:
--------------------------------
- Wall climb (code is in, just disabled atm.)
- Double jump
- Dash (Need to think if is this evading game only, or can the enemies stomped and/or dashed...)
- Checkpoint system (Libs/Pixel Adventure 1/Assets/Checkpoints)
  Possibilities:
    -> When player gets hit always respawn at checkpoint?
    -> When player loses all hearts, respawn at checkpoint instead of level start?
- Multiple save slots
- 2 player co op mode
- Menu coherence, is there need to make all to UI system (Canvas)
- Boss fights
- Teleports
- Push buttons to activate things in level
